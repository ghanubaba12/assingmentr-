    "context of computer vision tasks. Provide examples to illustrate each concept.\n",
    "ans-Object Detection:\n",
    "Object detection refers to the task of identifying and localizing multiple objects of interest within an image or video. It involves two main components: detecting the presence of objects and precisely localizing them with bounding boxes. Object detection algorithms not only classify objects into predefined categories but also provide information about their spatial location within the image. The output of an object detection algorithm typically includes the class label of each detected object and the corresponding bounding box coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In an image containing various objects like cars, pedestrians, and traffic signs, object detection algorithms can accurately detect and localize each object, providing information about their category and location. This information can be further used for tasks like autonomous driving, surveillance, or object tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object Classification:\n",
    "Object classification, on the other hand, focuses on determining the category or class label of a given object within an image. It involves training a model to recognize and classify objects into predefined classes or categories. Object classification algorithms typically take an input image and output the class label of the object present in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Given an image of a dog, an object classification algorithm can determine that the object belongs to the \"dog\" class. It doesn't provide information about the location or presence of other objects in the image. Object classification is commonly used in applications like image recognition, content-based image retrieval, and sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, object detection involves both localization and classification of multiple objects within an image, providing information about their presence and spatial coordinates. Object classification focuses solely on determining the category or class label of a single object within an image.\n",
